    1. Sixel
      Best option for iTerm2 and other terminals with Sixel suppport.
        
    2. Unicode color
      For this you need to decrease your terminal font size (Ctrl -).
      Preferably until you can't read this text anymore.
            
    3. Straight up ASCII
      If you hate colors. Or want a higher framerate (lol).
      Same thing goes for font size, make it tiny.
